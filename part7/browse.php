 <head><title>CS 564 PHP Project: Managing a Database of Books</title></head>

 <body>

This part simply executes a sql query to obtain all books, then displays
them one by one.<p>

We do not provide a sample implementation for this part, in the book
domain. You will have to implement such a capability for your project
domain.
