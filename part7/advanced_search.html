 <head><title>CS 564 PHP Project: Managing a Database of Books</title></head>

 <body>

This part provides an advanced search capability. That is, one should be able
to search for books using a combination of attributes, such as title and price, 
or title and quantity, etc.<p>

We do not provide a sample implementation 
for this part, in the book domain. You will have to implement such an advanced
search capability for your project domain.
